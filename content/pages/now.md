## Ship 30 for 30

On October 9th, I started [Ship 30 for 30](https://www.ship30for30.com/) which is a course teaching the fundamentals of writing on the internet. I just wrapped up the 30 days today.

## Buying a House

I'm closing on a house on November 16th. It's a bit of a fixer upper so I'll spend the end of November and all of December getting it ready for my daughter and I to move in January.

I'm looking forward to getting into carpentry and other DIY home renovation stuff. I've been watching a lot of videos on YouTube learning what I need to do to get everything ready.
