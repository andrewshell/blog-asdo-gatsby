## House Projects

For most of the year I was busy helping my mom move to Madison. She's now my next door neighbor. Because of this, I never got around to finishing the floors in my house and have lived with subfloors, staples, and tack strips in half of my house. I had hoped to wrap things up in time for Thanksgiving, but I decided not to stress myself out and I'll make the turkey and take it to my moms house.

## Releasing old Goals
