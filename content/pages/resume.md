## Skills

I've been building a wide variety of web applications for twenty years. Much of my work has used **PHP** and **Node.js**, but I've also worked extensively with **React**, **Ionic 4**, and **Angular**.

I'm incredibly comfortable **learning new things quickly** and **working with ambiguity**. I always consider the **goals of the business** before I work. The best way to be productive is to avoid spending time building the wrong thing.

I've spent a lot of time **speaking in public** as well as **teaching** groups and individuals. **Communication skills** are one of my best assets. I enjoy **coaching and mentoring** others.

## Experience

### Senior Web Engineer/ People Lead 2019-Present
_Johnson Health Tech, Cottage Grove, WI_

Senior Engineer building and maintaining a network of connected workout services and pipelines. Services are all on AWS using Docker, Node.js, PHP, Python, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, SQS, SNS, Firehose, MongoDB, and DynamoDB. Additionally, I mentor four developers as part of my People Lead role.

I'm responsible for planning and executing various solutions for our stakeholders, many of which involve coordinating work across other teams, both internal and external to our organization. I lead investigations to gather information and document systems and processes so I can recommend strategies for improving reliability, decreasing latency, and eliminating legacy tech debt.

### Senior Engineer 2018-2019

Worked on a variety of PHP and Node.js web applications for our clients. Designed and executed a git and Gitflow training program across the organization to unify our development practices.

### CTO & Lead Developer 2017-2018

Building web and mobile applications with PHP, Laravel, SVG, Angular, and the Ionic Framework. Close collaboration with the founder and CEO to iterate on his vision.

### Co-Founder and CTO 2011-2018
_Pinpoint Software, Madison, WI_

At Pinpoint Software, I built and maintained two SaaS products. Our flagship product DateCheckPro was a tool for grocery stores to manage and reduce expiring inventory. Shortly after, we launched Taskle, a tool for stores to manage recurring audits and checklists.

I designed database schemas (MySQL) and built the back and front ends during this time. Additionally, I worked closely with my co-founder and grocery industry partners.
