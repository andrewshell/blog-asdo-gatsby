At the time, Dave said it wasn't important to support, and frankly, nobody has ever complained about it. However, Dave is now rebooting the XML-RPC website, and he created a new node library to work with it. It seemed like time to add support.",

It is identical to http-post only instead of using the http scheme, it's https.  Not a big change, but especially with pressure from [Google](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https), [Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/), and [EFF](https://www.eff.org/encrypt-the-web) to https everything, it seems important. Dave has written a lot about how [HTTP is under attack](http://scripting.com/2018/02/23/174914.html), and I agree with him. However, I don't want to exclude someone from using rssCloud because they would prefer to use https. I feel like this is kosher because I'm continuing to support xml-rpc and http-post in the same way that it's documented, and the way his server worked. In his documentation, he talks about adding support for soap if people request it, so it seems like \"protocol\" was designed as a way to expand functionality down the road.",

You should not be instantiating anything in this method other than `LazyInterface` objects. The second part `modify` actually takes an instantiated object from the container and further modifies it. Ideally, you'd do as much as possible in `define` so you're not instantiating objects that you're not actually using.",

Well take a look at [JavaScript on Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=wordpress#q=javascript&cmpt=q). The line is pretty much parallel with PHP and I don't think anyone is suggesting that JavaScript is dying. JavaScript is showing a downward slope because people are no longer searching for JavaScript, they are [searching for jQuery](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=wordpress#q=jquery&cmpt=q) and [Backbone.js](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=wordpress#q=backbone.js&cmpt=q).",

There are certainly ways (as illustrated in the Robert Martin video) to write well-tested code that is outside of your framework and you use the framework as a delivery mechanism.

GitHub Pages out of the box does not support plugins because it would be a security issue.  The way around this of course is to separate your source and site into different branches and allow GitHub Pages to just generate the static pages generated by my local copy of Jekyll.",

It could use something like [oEmbed](http://oembed.com/) to pull in the content to show on the site, and if the other site was using Disqus they could also pull in the disqus_shortname and disqus_identifier from the page and embed that sites Disqus comments on the second site.

They haven't done it yet because so far the AppleTV is a hobby for them. They are waiting for the right moment, when the public is ready for what they have to offer. This may very well come at the same time as their own TV (as opposed to the current AppleTV set top box). Roku already has this sort of functionality in their channel store. Apple could take this concept into a TV set and make it super easy for people to buy apps for their TV. If they want [TWiT](http://twit.tv/), [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/) or [WSJ Live](http://online.wsj.com/public/page/designtech-wsjModuleLive.html) they just install an app. Obviously if it's premium content Apple will take their 30%.",

RSS is not particularly [user friendly](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/13/rss-is-not-not-not-not-not-dead/).  You have to find the RSS feed, copy the URL and paste it into your RSS aggregator. Some sites make it easier, like with Dave's blork software you just copy a little bookmarklet into your toolbar and when you find a site you want to follow you just click the bookmarklet and it takes you to your blork with the url filled in.",

Looking at his RSS feed I noticed that he references these OPML files in each item with a scripting2:source tag which is defined in the [Scripting2 namespace](https://web.archive.org/web/20120125093856/http://scripting2.com/namespace.html).",

In the [RSS 2.0 Specification](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html) they have an enclosure tag which is what's used for podcasting.  It would have been nice if the scripting2:source tag emulated the enclosure tag and required length and type in addition to the URL.

Obviously, I don't want to miss out on anything important. Well, first after I explained my organization system they pointed out that I should probably just kill my low-value folder. They also mentioned that if a website is important enough, you'll check it on your own and if you don't, maybe it isn't that important.",

Then on Monday, I had lunch with my good friend Dan and he brought up [Flipboard](http://www.flipboard.com/) which is sort of like a digital magazine that pulls its content from your social networks. I connect it to facebook and twitter and I get instant magazines. It doesn't show everything, but somehow curates the content and lays it out in a very attractive layout. The Facebook content is not particularly good, but I'm very impressed with the content it pulls out of Twitter. In addition to my main twitter feed, it allows me to create magazines from specific Twitter users or lists.",

I can check this once or twice a day and not feel like I have to clear out everything. Right now you're still somewhat limited with how you create magazines.

However I read the quote and I'm left scratching my head.  It actually doesn't seem from what they print in the article that Amazon is actually threatening to de-list publishers to sell with Apple.  I figure I should do a little more research and follow the links back to the original article from Melville House Publishing [Hysterical Amazon exec calls 911, says accelerator is stuck and he can’t keep from running over publishers](http://mhpbooks.com/mobylives/?p=13605) and it further solidifies my initial impression.

I have to say that Quicken has improved a lot since the last time I used it.  Today I spent some time digging into it a little more, got my reoccurring bills set up and started to look into the \"planning\" section of the application.",

When you watch a category you specify how much money you want to allocate to the category each month and as you spend money a little green bar moves across the screen showing how much of your allocation you've spent and how much is left.  It also has a larger bar across the top of the screen that represents your expected income for the month and it breaks it down into three sections \"Scheduled Bills\", \"Categorized Spending\" and \"Left Over\".  That way you can see right away how much money you actually have to spend as opposed to how much is in your bank account.",

Quicken calls it \"Rollover Reserve\" and basically that means that if you don't spend your allocated amount that month, the remainder goes into the reserve so you can spend it in the future or reallocate it to other categories.  This for me is a killer feature.  If I allocate $200 to entertainment every month I should be able to hold back and not spend the full $200 for a few months in order to save up for bigger purchases like an Xbox 360.",

This gave me many more options.  I could also trade games with other students at school.  One of the early ones I remember was a breakout game.  It wasn't long before I learned how to add new levels and started hacking it to do different things.",

Jones](http://paul-m-jones.com/)'s projects Savant and [Solar](http://solarphp.com/). But I though what he presented made so much sense and could help so many people. The one idea he really tried to drive home was to not pollute the global namespace. I've been trying to do this at work for a while (unfortunately not 100%) but when I created a filter class I named it CTG_Filter (CTG stands for Clarity Technology Group). Some areas he mentioned I never even thought of like session variables. Either way it was a great presentation.",
