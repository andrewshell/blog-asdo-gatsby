[RT Proxy](http://rt.geekity.com/) is a little site I created to support [Dave Winer's RT standard](http://scripting.com/stories/2012/02/03/aStandardForRting.html). This is fresh on the heels of my Radio2 RT WordPress Plugin which adds RT links to a WordPress site. Now anybody even if they don't have a website or link blog can RT to many popular social networks including Twitter, Facebook, and Google+.

## UPDATE: 

I've discontinued the Radio2 RT WordPress Plugin.
