My coach [Timothy Kenny](https://timothykenny.com/) really likes [numerical taxonomies](https://timothykenny.com/kenny-functional-areas-taxonomy-kfat/). However it hasn't clicked with me. This quote by Dorian Taylor explains why.

> The whole point of using human-readable symbols, and not, say, random strings or numbers, is to have a mnemonic or associative device such that a human being can look at a given symbol and infer to some extent what the thing is supposed to mean.

After testing [Schnack](https://schnack.cool/) and not being happy with the experience, I installed [CommentBox](https://commentbox.io/) for comments on the site. They advertise no ads or tracking.
