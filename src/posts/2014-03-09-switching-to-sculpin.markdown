Just over a year ago I [switched this blog to Jekyll](/switching-to-jekyll/) from a WordPress site.  Initially it was so I could run the site on GitHub Pages.  Then back in June, in order to use plugins I [changed the way I hosted my site](/changing-jekyll-config/) but it was still being hosted on GitHub Pages.  Later on (not sure when) I moved the self generated Jekyll site from GitHub Pages to Amazon S3.  Maintaining the different branches was too difficult.





I really liked the work-flow and hosting of Jekyll.  Having a static website that I just compile and publish is fantastic.  It's so much easier to maintain and host.





One problem I had with Jekyll was that it was written in Ruby.  I have nothing against Ruby, but it's not my language of choice, therefore it was difficult for me to customize the functionality the way I wanted to.





Today I relaunch my blog on [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io) which is a static site generator written in PHP by my friend and fellow Wisconsinite [Beau Simensen](https://beau.io/).





Now that my site is generated with a PHP based static site generator I'm able to dig in under the hood and tweak to my heart's content.





I also took this opportunity to tweak the design (again) hopefully making it prettier and more useful than before.
