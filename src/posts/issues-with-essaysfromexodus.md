This is a new site that I wasn't previously aware of. I found it through a link from this.how.

There doesn't seem to be an index of content on the site. For instance if I go to the homepage it just says it's an archive.

If I click on dates in the sidebar it goes to a 404 page. Ex: http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/2003/11/11

I really like the design of Manila sites. The Scripting News header looks really cool with the desert landscape and the cactus.
