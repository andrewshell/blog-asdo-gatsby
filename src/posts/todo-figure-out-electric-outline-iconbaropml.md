Also, in conjunction with this, how scriptable is it?

The button for Publish for Old School was built into the code. Could this have been done in iconbar.opml?

I would assume features like "New note" should be able to be created in iconbar.opml so if I wanted to use an OPML file in a different CMS I could create different buttons to scaffold content in the needed ways.

Features like "Edit attributes" are obviously core to the outliner, but perhaps it could be a core function that's triggered from iconbar.opml so users have complete control over the order of the icons. Perhaps that is a feature someone would prefer have in the menubar.opml?
