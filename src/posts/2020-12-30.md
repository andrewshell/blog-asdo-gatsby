The local area coffee shop [Ground Zero is closing](https://madison.com/wsj/entertainment/dining/restaurants/ground-zero-coffee-closes-but-might-reopen/article_306c7658-8623-5626-9369-a92b37964038.html). Whether or not this is permanent is still up in the air. I have a lot of memories at Ground Zero, including my [first PHP Meetup](/2004-12/16/first-php-meetup/) back in 2004.
