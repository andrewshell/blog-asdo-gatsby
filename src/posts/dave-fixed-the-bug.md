I just tested the fix for Little Outliner per Dave's instructions and it looks like everything worked correctly. Now, with my own personal nodeStorage server, I'm able to get an instant outliner URL that works correctly. I first tested with my demo.opml file and now I'm testing it with my notes.opml file. It works!
