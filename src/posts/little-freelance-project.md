I've been <a href="https://sive.rs/hellyeah">turning down</a> freelance projects because I like protecting what little free time I have lately. I certainly don't need the money right now. However, I reluctantly accepted one.  My favorite client Shawn who I've been working with on and off since the beginning of my career was in a bind. She has a project that needs to be live for a conference on Nov 16th and all her other developers are tied up on other projects that are running over. I worked on a similar project last year so I think it will be pretty easy. Should be able to wrap it up this week without too many issues.
