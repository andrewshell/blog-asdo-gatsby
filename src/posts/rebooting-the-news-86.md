Today's episode of [Rebooting The News](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/03/14/todaysPotluckPodcast.html) Jay was out of town so Dave had on Adam Curry and yours truly!  I wish I could say I was invited to be a guest, but Dave was just taking calls and picked me.  On the show I talk about my work trying to use WordPress as a microblog platform.  It's an interesting show, but if you want to skip directly to my part jump to 31:45.

Here's the [MP3](http://static.reallysimple.org/users/dave/2011/03/14/reboot11mar14.mp3).
