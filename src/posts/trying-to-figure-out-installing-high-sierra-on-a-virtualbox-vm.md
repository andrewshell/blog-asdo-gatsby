title: Trying to figure out installing High Sierra on a VirtualBox VM

All of the instructions I'm finding are basically <a href="https://www.geekrar.com/how-to-create-macos-high-sierra-iso-file/">this</a>.

The third step where I call createinstallmedia fails with a message "A error occurred erasing the disk." 

I'm trying now to use a real USB stick which is what I think Apple expects you to use.

It's been sitting with the message "Copying installer files to disk" but I expect this will take a while so I guess we'll see.

It finished but booting from the USB in VirtualBox seemed to technically work, but I got a lot of errors on the screen.

I'm trying VMWare Fusion right now which seems to be able to boot directly from "Install macOS High Sierra.app" and doesn't require jumping through hoops trying to create an ISO.

So far it seems to be installing.

I'm much farther along after 5 minutes of VMWare Fusion than I was after an hour of VirtualBox. LOL

Seems like it's up and running.
