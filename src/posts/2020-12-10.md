Dorian Taylor seems to be [working on something](https://twitter.com/doriantaylor/status/1336751714737614848) that generates context around arbitrary tags. I'm hoping to find out more as this relates to a project I'm working on.

I try to say positive versions of habitual phrases. For example, if someone thanks me for something, instead of saying "No problem," which is my habitual reply, I try to say "you're welcome," "my pleasure," or "happy to help." If I say "no problem," it implies that I should have perceived it as a problem and negated it. [Seth agrees](https://seths.blog/2020/12/welcome-and-problems/).
