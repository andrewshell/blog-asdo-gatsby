Dave Winer uses Facebook comments on his Liveblog and today I wanted to comment on [his post about liveblogging](http://liveblog.co/users/davewiner/2015/05/22/thePointOfLiveblogging.html). However before I did this I had to check something out.

I went on Facebook and found [where he had posted a link to his post](https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/350709271803151) and was surprised to find one comment on Facebook and zero comments on his post.

Why doesn't Facebook keep these in sync? I would think it would be way better for Facebook and for bloggers if comments on one page showed up on the other. Why split the conversation?
