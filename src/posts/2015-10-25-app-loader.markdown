_UPDATE 2015-12-17: [Dave has moved on](http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2015/12/03/0553.html) to [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) so I've discontinued this project._

Yesterday Dave Winer requested on his website [Let's make nw.js easy to start up](http://scripting.com/2015/10/24/letsMakeNwjsEasyToStartUp.html) and he asked for a simple app that he could use to bootstrap [nw.js](http://nwjs.io/) apps.

Here is my attempt at a solution:




    
  * [Source on Github](https://github.com/andrewshell/app-loader)

    
  * <del>NW.js package</del>

    
  * <del>OSX Bundled App</del>



If you're using a Mac the easiest will be the OSX Bundled App

If you're using Linux or Windows you'll want the NW.js package and follow instructions on [How to run apps](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/How-to-run-apps).

If you're a NW.js hacker and want to see what I'm actually doing you can view the source.
