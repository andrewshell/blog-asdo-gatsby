[Gustavo Pires](https://twitter.com/gpiresnt) recently introduced [Web Data Render](https://webdatarender.com/). WDR is a novel experiment where the web page is a JSON document with a script tag (in the structure). The script reads the content and renders the page. A client can use these pages as an API or a browsable site.

<abbr title="Today I Learned">TIL</abbr>: You can use the value `` `date` `` in a git commit message for the current date and time.
