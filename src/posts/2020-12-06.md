Writing in an outliner is frictionless. I type a blurb and hit publish, and it's on my website in seconds. Very cool.

I'm using a desktop outliner, and the piece I'm missing is Grammarly. It's a significant crutch I use to make sure what I'm writing is legible. If I move to [Little Outliner](http://littleoutliner.com/), I can probably get it working. Until then, I'll just copy and paste between the two.

I am continuing to hack on my new site. Dave said the about card on the homepage was dominating the page, and I agreed with him. I added lots of navigation links: previous, next, breadcrumbs, the whole nine yards. Still have to add a search engine.
