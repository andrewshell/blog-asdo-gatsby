Derek Sivers has released the source of his website. Instead of GitHub, he's using [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/), which I haven't heard of before. [git.sr.ht/~sivers/sive.rs](https://git.sr.ht/~sivers/sive.rs)

I'm debating adding comments to my site. I won't use Disqus because it's turned into a bloated advertisement. I've had my eye on [schnack](https://schnack.cool/), which is self-hosted and free of tracking.

Last night I started surveying the landscape of javascript search libraries. My site previously used [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/), but the index was clientside and regenerated every time I built my website. I am looking at [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) as a possible engine that gets incrementally updated with new content and has a persistent index.
