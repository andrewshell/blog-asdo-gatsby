Hoopla! That word seems to have become a part of my brand. It started as me just being goofy one day at school after watching [Shock Treatment](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G6BLGK/), but now has become my stock greeting when I see people I know. It's gotten to the point where the hoopla precedes me. Once I met a boss's wife for the first time and after I said, "Hi, nice to meet you," she was like, "and.... don't I get a hoopla?"

I live in Madison, WI with my wife Andrea and daughter Piper. I love being a husband and dad. I wish I could stay at home and homeschool Piper, but it's not realistic for our family.

I'm a web developer. I wish I could say I'm a person who happens to do computer programming for a living, but who am I kidding? Programming is a part of who I am, and even if I had a billion dollars and didn't have to work another day in my life, I'd still be programming.

I like a lot of music and had been enjoying my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1285501863) account. It's sort of like a drug for me. The fact that I can listen to just about anything I want whenever I want to is great. I bounce around from artist to artist, listening to whatever I can get my hands on. I love it.

I'm big on community. I founded and currently co-organize [Madison PHP](http://www.madisonphp.com/) (a group for web nerds like me). I'm also involved in other groups and events in town, which all relate to the internet.
