## Separation

As of February, 8th my wife of 7 years moved out. We will share custody of my daughter Piper moving forward.

## Moving and House Sale

Since I'm getting a divorce, my wife and I decided to sell our house. I signed a lease for an apartment down the street. Since February 23rd, I've been burning myself out, going through everything in our house, and trying to move. It's been very unpleasant, and I'm not sure how I'm going to get this done.

Originally, we had hoped to have the house listed on March 11th. However, we're still not listed. My wife has helped a bit, and her folks have been over as well, but I'm mostly doing all this by myself.

## rssCloud Server

I'm working on an upgrade to the rssCloud server I launched back in 2015. I've come a long way in my Node.js development skills, and Node has changed a lot as well. The new release makes sure the server will target Node 12 LTS for future compatibility.

I've rewritten the code to use async/await instead of callbacks to improve readability.

With Dave rebooting [XML-RPC](http://xmlrpc.com/), I've decided to add support for that protocol. It was supported in the OPML editor version but wasn't a priority when I created my server initially.

This has been put on hold for the moment until I finish moving and sell the house.

## Johnson Health Tech

On February 4th, I was made lead developer of a newly formed team created to be a custodian of many of our backend APIs. I'll be mentoring two developers and a QA Analyst.
