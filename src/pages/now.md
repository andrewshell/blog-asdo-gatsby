## Separation

As of February, 8th my wife of 7 years moved out. We will share custody of my daughter Piper moving forward.

## rssCloud Server

I'm working on an upgrade to the rssCloud server I launched back in 2015. I've come a long way in my Node.js development skills, and Node has changed a lot as well. The new release makes sure the server will target Node 12 LTS for future compatibility.

I've rewritten the code to use async/await instead of callbacks to improve readability.

With Dave rebooting [XML-RPC](http://xmlrpc.com/), I've decided to add support for that protocol. It was supported in the OPML editor version but wasn't a priority when I created my server initially.

## Music

Currently in heavy rotation I'm listening to Brooke Candy, Slayyyter, Pussy Riot, Sia, Cher, Taylor Swift, Oingo Boingo, Dua Lipa, and Carly Rae Jepsen.

## Testing Web Apps

At work I'm taking over many of the backend APIs which are written in Node.js and Express. There really isn't any test coverage but there is a need to refactor and cleanup the code.  I'm trying to learn the best ways to take these "legacy" apps and start adding test coverage so I have the ability to refactor and have some confidence that I'm not breaking things.

## Johnson Health Tech

On February 4th, I was made lead developer of a newly formed team created to be a custodian of many of our backend APIs. I'll be mentoring two developers and a QA Analyst.

## GatsbyJS

I replaced my WordPress site with a new site using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It's basically a static site generator, but for react sites. It's very fast and produces an optimized website that I'm hosting with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
