## Separation

As of February, 8th my wife of 7 years moved out. We will share custody of my daughter Piper moving forward.

## rssCloud Server

I'm working on an upgrade to the rssCloud server I launched back in 2015. I've come a long way in my Node.js development skills, and Node has changed a lot as well. The new release makes sure the server will target Node 14 LTS for future compatibility.

I've rewritten the code to use async/await instead of callbacks to improve readability.

With Dave rebooting [XML-RPC](http://xmlrpc.com/), I've decided to add support for that protocol. It was supported in the OPML editor version but wasn't a priority when I created my server initially.

Development was put on hold until I finished moving and sold the house, but I'm working on it again and hope to have it released soon.

If you're interested you can watch the [rssCloud Server GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrewshell/rsscloud-server).

## Building a Second Brain

I signed up to be a part of Cohort 11 of the [Building a Second Brain course](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/).

So far it's been really interesting. I find that I have a much better grasp of the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) and I'm starting to find ways to regularly capture all the knowledge that's flowing around me on a daily basis.

I hope this will form part of the foundation of what I hope to work on and accomplish next.

## Johnson Health Tech

On February 4th, I was made lead developer of a newly formed team created to be a custodian of many of our backend APIs. I'll be mentoring two developers and a QA Analyst.
