## Building a Second Brain

I signed up to be a part of Cohort 11 of the [Building a Second Brain course](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/).

It was worth the time and money to take it. It has helped me think differently about taking notes, collecting information, and organizing and processing information.

The ideas I've generated while taking the course feed into my thoughts around [changing my website's format](/rethinking-blogs/) into a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

## rssCloud Server

I'm working on an upgrade to the rssCloud server I launched back in 2015. I've come a long way in my Node.js development skills, and Node has changed a lot as well. The new release makes sure the server will target Node 14 LTS for future compatibility.

I've rewritten the code to use async/await instead of callbacks to improve readability.

With Dave rebooting [XML-RPC](http://xmlrpc.com/), I've decided to add support for that protocol. It was supported in the OPML editor version but wasn't a priority when I created my server initially.

Development was put on hold until I finished moving and sold the house, but I'm slowly working on it again and hope to have it released soon.

If you're interested you can watch the [rssCloud Server GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrewshell/rsscloud-server).
