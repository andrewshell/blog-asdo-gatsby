## Testing Web Apps

At work I'm taking over many of the backend APIs which are written in Node.js and Express. There really isn't any test coverage but there is a need to refactor and cleanup the code.  I'm trying to learn the best ways to take these "legacy" apps and start adding test coverage so I have the ability to refactor and have some confidence that I'm not breaking things.

## GatsbyJS

I replaced my WordPress site with a new site using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It's basically a static site generator, but for react sites. It's very fast and produces an optimized website that I'm hosting with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Music

Currently in heavy rotation I'm listening to Ani DiFranco, Cher, Rina Sawayama, Sia, The Prodigy, No Doubt, Dorian Electra, They Might Be Giants, Taylor Swift, Dua Lipa, and Carly Rae Jepsen.

## Johnson Health Tech

I started a new job at Johnson Health Tech on October 14th, 2019. I'm working on backend APIs for their fitness equipment services. All my work so far has been in Node.js and Express.
