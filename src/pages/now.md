## Johnson Health Tech

I just started a new job at Johnson Health Tech on October 14th, 2019. I'm working on backend APIs for their fitness equipment services. All my work so far has been in Node.js and Express.

## GatsbyJS

I replaced my WordPress site with a new site using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It's basically a static site generator, but for react sites. It's very fast and produces an optimized website that I'm hosting with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Netlify also offers a CMS that works with static sites and I'll probably investigate that at some point in the not too distant future.
