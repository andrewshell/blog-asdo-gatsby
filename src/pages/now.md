title: What Iâ€™m doing now

## Separation

As of February, 8th my wife of 7 years moved out. We will share custody of my daughter Piper moving forward.

## Moving and House Sale

We sold the house. It was on the market for less than 24 hours before we accepted an offer. Closing was on May 1st. It was a long, drawn-out move. Fortunately, I was only moving down the street.

I did most of the moving by myself. Due to self-isolation, it didn't seem ideal to invite people over to help. I did have to ask for help with the larger items.

Now, I'm waiting for Goodwill and Half Price Books to open so I can donate and sell years of accumulated crap.

## rssCloud Server

I'm working on an upgrade to the rssCloud server I launched back in 2015. I've come a long way in my Node.js development skills, and Node has changed a lot as well. The new release makes sure the server will target Node 12 LTS for future compatibility.

I've rewritten the code to use async/await instead of callbacks to improve readability.

With Dave rebooting [XML-RPC](http://xmlrpc.com/), I've decided to add support for that protocol. It was supported in the OPML editor version but wasn't a priority when I created my server initially.

Development was put on hold until I finished moving and sold the house. I will be picking this back up now.

## Johnson Health Tech

On February 4th, I was made lead developer of a newly formed team created to be a custodian of many of our backend APIs. I'll be mentoring two developers and a QA Analyst.
