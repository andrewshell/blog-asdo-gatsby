Hoopla! That word seems to have become a part of my personal brand. Started out as me just being goofy one day at school after watching [Shock Treatment](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G6BLGK/) but now has become my stock greeting when I see people I know. In fact it's gotten to the point where the hoopla precedes me. Once I met a bosses wife for the first time and after I said "Hi, nice to meet you" she was like "and.... don't I get a hoopla?"

I'm a programmer (specifically [PHP](http://php.net/) if you care to know). I wish I could say I'm a person who happens to do computer programming for a living, but who am I kidding? Programming is a part of who I am and even if I had a billion dollars and didn't have to work another day in my life I'd still be programming.

I like a lot of music and had been enjoying my [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/1285501863) account. It's sort of like a drug for me. The fact that I can listen to just about anything I want whenever I want to is great. I just bounce around from artist to artist listening to whatever I can get my hands on. I love it.

I'm big on community. I founded and currently co-organize the [Madison PHP Meetup Group](http://www.madisonphp.com/) (group for web nerds like me). I'm also involved in other groups and events in town which all relate to the internet.
