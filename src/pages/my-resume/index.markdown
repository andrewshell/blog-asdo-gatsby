## Skills

For fifteen years I've been building a wide variety of web applications. Much of my work has been with **PHP**, but I've also worked extensively with Angular and the Ionic Framework. Most of my recent development has been with **React, Redux, Laravel, Ionic 4 and Angular**.

I'm incredibly comfortable **learning new things quickly** and **working with ambiguity**. I always consider the **goals of the business** before I work. The best way to be productive is to avoid spending time building the wrong thing.

I've spent a lot of time **speaking in public** as well as **teaching** groups and individuals. **Communication skills** are one of my best assets. I enjoy **coaching and mentoring** others.
